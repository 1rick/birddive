        <h1>Work</h1>
        
        <div><p>I'm a content strategist / marketing professional living and working in Tokyo, Japan. With a background in online journalism, I tell compelling stories about technology companies.  Beginning as a regular columnist for CNet, The Japan Times (technology page) and CNN,  I then served as editor-in-chief during the formative years of new media startups <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/about-us/">TechInAsia</a> and then <a href="https://thebridge.jp/">The Bridge</a>. </p>
<p>My achievements in the startup media space attracted the attention of advertising agencies who enlisted my help (for brands like <a href="/kandl.html">Nikon</a> and <a href="/ibm.html">IBM</a>) in creative content and digital strategy. I'm currently a marketing manager in the electronics space.</p>
<h3 id="my-story-is-all-about-finding-your-story">My story is all about finding your story</h3>
<p>I've been a creative web professional for over a decade, in both new media and agency roles. I pride myself in telling stories that go beyond just the written word.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspired Writing: I facilitate speedy, flexible content workflows that adapt to any situation or team. My technical industry experience gives me an authoritative voice. <a href="/writing.html">Read my writing samples here</a>.</li>
<li>Engaging Visuals: Different stories often call for different forms of media. My storytelling can integrate original imagery, data visualization, or video -- whichever makes the message most clear. Check out some of my <a href="/photography.html">photos</a> and <a href="/projects.html">other projects</a>.</li>
<li>Pro Quality Ready for the World: I ensure that content doesn't compromise on quality, and that the brand message meets the high expectations of our users and stakeholders. I speak a few languages, but more importantly, I understand what it takes to achieve effective cross-cultural communication.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-skills">My Skills</h3>
<p>I take pride in being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills">T-shaped professional</a>. Content is my core. But with first-hand experience in design, development, and agile methods (Certified ScrumMaster), I can communicate across disciplines with ease to facilitate great teamwork. </p>

<h4 id="ibm-studios-havas-worldwide">IBM Studios / Havas Worldwide</h4>
<p>IBM Studios is a worldwide network of creative digital studios that apply data, technology, and agile methods to the crafting of digital experiences. Contracted from Havas Worldwide, I led Content Strategy for the Tokyo Studio, coordinating with our New York Studio and IBM Japan on projects designed to have global impact for the company. <a href="/ibm.html">View samples of my work at IBM</a>. (06/2014 - 07/2015)</p>
<h4 id="kl-nikon">K&amp;L / Nikon</h4>
<p>K&amp;L Inc is a creative agency based in Tokyo. I contributed on the company’s long-standing Nikon account, producing English-language content for use in global advertising materials for DSLR cameras, including the flagship D4S model. Samples can be found here. <a href="/kandl.html">View samples of my work here</a>. (02/2013 - 06/2014)</p>
<h3 id="techinasiacom">TechInAsia.com</h3>
<p>As chief editor of this digital news startup (<a href="https://www.techinasia.com/about">techinasia.com</a>), I managed a large global team of about 20 people located around Asia, and coordinated daily publishing on our content management system. I ensured that HTML layouts were well-designed and in compliance with the styleguide I created, and I also handled social media promotion via Twitter, Facebook, and other channels.  (04/2011 - 01/2013)</p>
<h3 id="various-publications">Various publications</h3>
<p>I've always enjoyed writing, whether it's for work or for fun. In addition to leading media startups like Tech In Asia and The Bridge as Editor-in-Chief, I was a regular technology columnist/contributor for The Japan Times newspaper, CNet, and CNN, among a range of others. Over the years I also have occasionally reported on international volleyball tournaments for the FIVB (via the Japan Volleyball Association) as a change of pace.</p></div>
