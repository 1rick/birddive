<p>I'm not great with labels, but if you need one I might be a <a href="/writing.html">writer</a> -- though I really enjoy design and web development too. These days I work in marketing with a focus on digital content strategy, where all those disciplines come together. Previously I worked in media, as a contributing technology writer for a range of publications and as chief editor for a couple of young media startups.</p>

<h3 id="issues-and-viewpoints">Issues and viewpoints</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm continually trying to understand how technology (especially mobile devices and social media) can be both a positive and negative influence upon me and my family.<ul>
<li>I'm frustrated with how Facebook and Youtube have become a breeding ground for lunacy, especially when it comes to science and politics. At the same time, Youtube when used responsibly, <a href="/projects.html#fugu">can be wonderful</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I like extending the life of almost everything I own, especially old PC hardware with Ubuntu Linux, Thinkpads in particular. I'm a big believer in "<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro">right to repair</a>".</li>
<li>I think making websites shouldn't have to be nearly as hard as it is right now. I'm knocking around the idea of making a simple static site generator free for everyone, because we should be able to do better than Wordpress for an easy-to-use and free website builder.</li>
<li>Everyone should be considered and treated as equal. Be nice. </li>
<li>Pancakes are a potentially great solution for most day-to-day problems, not just at breakfast.</li>
