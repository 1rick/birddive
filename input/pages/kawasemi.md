### Bluebird Pocket Planner


**What is Bluebird Pocket Planner?** It's a pocket-size notebook that prompts you to plan your weeks and days, safe from smartphone notifications and social media timelines. 

Packing twenty weeks of your most ambitious goals into a tiny notebook, Bluebird guides you through two 10-week periods that help you break down long term projects into bite-size daily tasks. Let's admit it. We're all rather lazy. But Bluebird is a good way to achieve some consistency while avoiding the unnecessary complexity of some other productivity systems. *Bluebird is simple pocket productivity powered by a pen, paper, and you.*

The physical version is currently sold out, but printable versions are still available below. I may do a version 2 in the future; I'm not yet sure.
