### K&L for Nikon


While at Tokyo-based agency K&L, I was involved in conceptualizing, writing, editing, and planning for various Nikon communication materials, including product brochures and websites. Projects that I've worked on include:

#### Nikon D4S (flagship DSLR)

* I worked on content for the [website](http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d4s/), [brochure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3kqe-fbHOHIQTZiN0pmSDlHMUE/view?usp=sharing), and teaser campaign.
* planned and story-boarded promo videos (post-production) featuring pro sports photographers [Dave Black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4aRSZaDRq8) and [Robert Beck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4aRSZaDRq8) (see below).
