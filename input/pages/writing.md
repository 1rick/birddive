In addition to leading media startups like Tech In Asia and The Bridge as editor-in-chief, I was a regular technology columnist/contributor for The Japan Times newspaper, CNet, CNN, and a range of others.

You can find some selected writing samples below, where I've tried to pick from a wide range topics and formats. I've included some personal blog posts and photo essays here as well.

### From Way, Way Back

* [Burned to Light: Stoker's Dracula Endures in Murnau's Nosferatu](../static/projects/burned_to_light/) - This was my university dissertation way back in 2002. My university didn't have an official film department, there were film courses offered under the English and German programs, so I ended up doing much of both. Early German Expressionist cinema was a lot of fun for me. In retrospect this isn't a particularly interesting piece of writing, but I'll keep it here for archival purposes.
