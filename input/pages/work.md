I'm a content strategist / marketing professional living and working in Tokyo, Japan. With a background in online journalism, I tell compelling stories about technology companies.  Beginning as a regular columnist for CNet, The Japan Times (technology page) and CNN,  I then served as editor-in-chief during the formative years of new media startups [TechInAsia][4] and then [The Bridge][5]. 

My achievements in the startup media space attracted the attention of advertising agencies who enlisted my help (for brands like [Nikon][6] and [IBM][7]) in creative content and digital strategy. I'm currently a marketing manager in the electronics space.

### My story is all about finding your story

I've been a creative web professional for over a decade, in both new media and agency roles. I pride myself in telling stories that go beyond just the written word.

* Inspired Writing: I facilitate speedy, flexible content workflows that adapt to any situation or team. My technical industry experience gives me an authoritative voice. [Read my writing samples here](/writing.html).
* Engaging Visuals: Different stories often call for different forms of media. My storytelling can integrate original imagery, data visualization, or video -- whichever makes the message most clear. Check out some of my [photos](/photography.html) and [other projects](/projects.html).
* Pro Quality Ready for the World: I ensure that content doesn't compromise on quality, and that the brand message meets the high expectations of our users and stakeholders. I speak a few languages, but more importantly, I understand what it takes to achieve effective cross-cultural communication.


### My Skills

I take pride in being a [T-shaped professional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills). Content is my core. But with first-hand experience in design, development, and agile methods (Certified ScrumMaster), I can communicate across disciplines with ease to facilitate great teamwork.

I've always enjoyed writing, whether it's for work or for fun. In addition to leading media startups like Tech In Asia and The Bridge as Editor-in-Chief, I was a regular technology columnist/contributor for The Japan Times newspaper, CNet, and CNN, among a range of others. Over the years I also have occasionally reported on international volleyball tournaments for the FIVB (via the Japan Volleyball Association) as a change of pace.
