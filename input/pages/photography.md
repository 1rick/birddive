Recently one of my hobbies has been bird photography, in particular kingfishers. But over the years I've shot a range of things, both as part of my media work and just for fun as well. Below is a selection of images, most shot with a Nikon D7100. These days I like to shoot with a more portable Nikon p5100, though mostly for family photos.
