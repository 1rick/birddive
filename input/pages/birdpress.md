title: Birdpress Static Site Generator
slug: birdpress

---


BirdPress is a static site generator that I wrote, with the intention of being simpler than most of the alternatives out there. Let's face it, most of those were written by developers, for developers. 

I don't consider myself a developer, but I like making websites. And that should be a simple process. BirdPress is a solution I made for me. If it works for anyone else out there, please feel free to use it. Feedback is [welcome](/contact.html).
