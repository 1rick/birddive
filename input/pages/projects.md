### Birdpress 

This is the static site generator that I wrote, with the assistance of ChatGPT. I mostly built it for me, and I use it to generate this website.

### Bluebird Pocket Planner

This was a personal project that I did to see if I could bring a product to market on my own from start to finish. It was a pretty educational process, where I did everything ranging from the iterative design the book, the print layout, website design and development, e-commerce integration, and a little bit of marketing. You can learn more over on the [pocket planner](/kawasemi.html) page.

### Fugu.tv

This is a simple but useful page of curated Youtube channels, with content that I think is ok for kids. I made it with my own kids in mind. There's a lot of good content on Youtube, but I think everyone needs a little help in figuring out where it's at. This is my effort to do that:

* [www.fugu.tv](https://fugu.tv)
* [Fugu.tv Youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7hiNe3pr0G5Rs5DDJCGSPw) (hopefully another method of curating, via playlists)
