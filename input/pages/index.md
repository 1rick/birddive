Hey there, I'm R.

I'm not great with labels, but if you need one I might be a [writer](/writing.html) -- though I really enjoy design and web development too. These days I work in marketing with a focus on digital content strategy, where all those disciplines come together. Previously I worked in media, as a contributing technology writer for a range of publications and as chief editor for a couple of young media startups.

### Things that interest me right now:

*   [Guitar](/tags/guitar.html)
*   Cooking

### Issues and viewpoints

*   I'm continually trying to understand how technology (especially mobile devices and social media) can be both a positive and negative influence upon me and my family.
    *   I'm frustrated with how Facebook and Youtube have become a breeding ground for lunacy, especially when it comes to science and politics. At the same time, Youtube when used responsibly, [can be wonderful](/projects.html#fugu).
*   I like extending the life of almost everything I own, especially old PC hardware with Ubuntu Linux, Thinkpads in particular. I'm a big believer in "[right to repair](https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro)".
*   I think making websites shouldn't have to be nearly as hard as it is right now. I'm knocking around the idea of making a simple static site generator free for everyone, because we should be able to do better than Wordpress for an easy-to-use and free website builder.
*   Everyone should be considered and treated as equal. Be nice. 
*   Pancakes are a potentially great solution for most day-to-day problems, not just at breakfast.
