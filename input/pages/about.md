I'm a Canadian dude living and working in Tokyo. I like experimenting -- sometimes cooking, sometimes very bad guitar, sometimes [photography](/photography.html) or random [projects](/projects.html). I like design and development, though I'm an expert at neither. For work, I'm a marketer but in a past life I was a technology writer/reporter.

This website is both an archive for past writings and ramblings, as well as my personal footprint on the interwebs where I've made lots of great friends in the past. If you might be a future friend, do say [hello](/contact.html).
