title: Now

---


Here's what I'm doing now:

* Location: Still Tokyo. Not traveling much these days. 
* Studying: 
    * Guitar/Ukulele: After a couple of years of ukulele study with [UkuleleUnderground.com](https://ukuleleunderground.com/), I'm starting to feel comfortable with guitar, both electric and acoustic. Can't help trying out the Nirvana Unplugged catalog. [Here's my song list that I'm working on now](https://gist.github.com/1rick/14d89c741982d78cfd5f94a1e0d5171e).
    * Language: Perpetually studying Japanese, though picking up the pace recently with WaniKani kanji study. My Chinese is getting really rusty, but Japanese takes priority.
    * Cooking: Enjoying the Julia Child french cooking books complemented by Anti-chef's [Jamie & Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihf0S97oxuQ&list=PLnBJiJ3X1GSZU3y1LVsRwLNSMMxvfBcGe) videos. Also rediscovering Chinese and Sichuan food through a few books as well.
    * Photography: I sort of paused the bird photography in favor of photographing my kids. And I've put aside film photography, in favor of a Nikon D40 and a p5100 -- both very film-ish with CCD sensors. 
* Reading: My ongoing reading list is [here](https://gist.github.com/1rick/f8095ed3d0906c48708f1451afbe0506).
Work: Marketing stuff
